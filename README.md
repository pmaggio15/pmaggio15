👋 Hi, I’m Paige Maggio  
Frontend Engineer • React • TypeScript • Next.js

I build production grade web applications with a focus on clean component architecture, performance, and polished user experience. I’ve shipped frontend applications for AI driven products, authenticated dashboards, and real world workflow systems.
