👋 Hi, I'm Paige Maggio  
Frontend Engineer • React • TypeScript • AI-Driven Interfaces

I build production-grade web applications with a focus on clean component architecture, performance, and polished user experience. I’ve shipped AI-powered platforms, authenticated dashboards, and full-stack systems used in real-world workflows.

Most of my work lives in the pinned repositories below — including AI products, booking platforms, and scalable frontend systems.
